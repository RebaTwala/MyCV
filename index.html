      <h1>Rebaone Twala</h1>

      <p id="schooling">My name is Rebaone Twala. I was born in April 2006 in Pretoria Gauteng.<br>
        My schooling began at the International School of South Africa in the north west, <br>
        where I attended primary.  <br>
        I graduated from Curro Roodeplaat high school in 2024 as prefect chairman of outreach, <br>
        during which I was in charge of organising charity events and fundraisers. <br>
        I am currently employed at OrthoMarketPlace (RICOVAX) as a general administrator. <br>
    </p>

    <p id="aspirations"> My goal in life is to become a successful civil engineer, and to get my masters degree in the field. <br>
                         I am very passionate about artistry as well, I graduated top 5 in my art class during high school, and <br>
                         I hope to one day own a large collection of artwork. I am particularly fond of the works of Goya, <br>
                         Artemisia Gentileschi and Nandipha Mntambo. <br>
                         I hope to one day also find my place in the world of creativity, in a form that speaks to me. <br>

                        </p>
